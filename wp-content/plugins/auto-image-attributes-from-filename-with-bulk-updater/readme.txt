Image alt text and title is critical for your image SEO and will help users discover your images (and there by your website) in Google / Yahoo / Bing image search. 

Proper alt text also helps people who are blind or who have low vision understand your images there by improving the accessibility of your website. This will open up your website to a new segment of visitors and increase your traffic.

With this plugin you can:

* Set the image filename as the image Title.
* Set the image filename as the image Caption.
* Set the image filename as the image Description.
* Set the image filename as the image Alt Text. This was a default feature in WordPress before 4.7. The plugin restores this essential feature which is great for SEO.
* Insert Image Title into post HTML. WordPress stopped adding Image Titles to images since WordPress 3.5. The plugin restores it.
* Remove hyphens from the image filename.
* Remove underscores from the image filename.
* Remove full stops from filename.
* Remove commas from filename.
* Remove all numbers from filename.
* Choose to turn off any of the above mentioned features.

With the bulk updater you can: 

* Set the image filename as image Title, Caption, Description and Alt Text after removing hyphens and underscores from the filename.
* Update any number of images in your Media Library in one click.

If your image filename is *My_image-name.jpg*, your Image Title, Caption, Description And Alt Text will be *My image name*. 

The plugin settings and bulk updater are in WordPress Admin > Settings > Image Attributes. Here you can choose which attributes to update for NEW uploads. 

Please remember to take a database backup before running the bulk updater. The bulk updater updates ALL attributes for existing images in the Media Library and ignores the settings set for NEW uploads.

**Image Attributes Pro**

A pro add-on is now available for the plugin. Check out [Image Attributes Pro](https://imageattributespro.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme).

The pro add-on can update the image attributes from not just the image filename, but also from the post / page / product / custom post type title. You can fine tune the bulk updater settings and even clean up the actual image filename.
