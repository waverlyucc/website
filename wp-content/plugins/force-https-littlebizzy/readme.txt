#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io) web servers with PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and usability reasons, we highly recommend avoiding WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

Any of our WordPress plugins may also be loaded as "Must-Use" plugins by using our free [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script in the `mu-plugins` directory.

#### Disclaimer ####

We released this plugin in response to our managed hosting clients asking for better access to their server, and our primary goal will remain supporting that purpose. Although we are 100% open to fielding requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you keep these conditions in mind, and refrain from slandering, threatening, or harassing our team members in order to get a feature added, or to otherwise get "free" support. The only place you should be contacting us is in our free [**Facebook group**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/littlebizzy/) which has been setup for this purpose, or via GitHub if you are an experienced developer. Thank you!

== Installation ==

1. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/force-https-littlebizzy`
2. Activate via WP Admin > Plugins
3. Test plugin is working:

Load a non-HTTPS version of any page, and it should be automatically redirected to the HTTPS version. In addition, most if not all insecure links and resources should now be loaded over HTTPS, regardless of original code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin install SSL for my site? =

No. You will first need to order/setup SSL on your server (web host) before activating this plugin.

= After installing this plugin, my site is inaccessible? =

You probably do not have SSL installed yet on your server (web host) which is a prerequisite.

= Are there any potential drawbacks/errors with this plugin? =

The only potential error is a 404 error for external resources that do not already support HTTPS.

= Does this plugin affect my website's speed or performance? =

No, it should not. It's very lightweight and should be cached in PHP Opcache and DNS/browser (301s).

= My developer installed this for me, is he taking shortcuts? =

Mostly likely your developer wants you to be extra protected from insecure resources. This plugin can be (should be) installed as an additional layer of protection/stability even if you already redirect to HTTPS elsewhere (server, CloudFlare, etc). It does not hurt anything to force SSL in multiple places, and in fact provides better redundancy for your security. That said, installing this plugin is not a cure-all and your server (etc) should still be re-configured for SSL too when possible.

= What HTTP header codes does this plugin send to browsers? =

It generates 301 codes for any http version of any page and redirects to https version of that page.

= Does this plugin work with CloudFlare SSL? =

Yes, it can be used with CloudFlare's "flexible" or "full" SSL to avoid "too many redirects" spinning errors.

= How can I change this plugin's settings? =

Currenly no settings page exists, but we may add one in future versions.

= I have a question or comment, how can I let you know? =

Please avoid leaving negative reviews in order to get a feature implemented. Stalking or harassing our team members is also not okay; we will expose those who attempt to extort or threaten us. Instead, you may post on the public WordPress.org forums if you like and other members may be able to help you. Since this is a free plugin, we do not offer support for it; we are also no longer involved at the WordPress.org forums. We recommend joining our Facebook group instead:
