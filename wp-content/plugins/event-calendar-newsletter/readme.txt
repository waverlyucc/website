Easily put events from your WordPress event calendar inside of a newsletter. Quickly use an included design or create your own!

== Description ==

Stop manually copying, pasting and formatting events you're promoting from your WordPress events calendar!  Take your events calendar and turn it into a newsletter-friendly format, so you can quickly copy your events into your newsletters (ie. MailChimp, MailPoet, Active Campaign, or other newsletter sending service).

All you have to do is select how far in the future you want events for your newsletter and click Generate.

There's no programming required.  You can preview the output then quickly copy/paste it into your newsletter.  Spend a lot less time creating newsletters of your upcoming events!
