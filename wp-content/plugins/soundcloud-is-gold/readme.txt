== Top Features ==

* **Browse** through your or someone lese soundcloud tracks, sets and favourites from a tab in the media upload window, no need to go back and forth between Soundcloud and your website.
* **Save multiple users**, very useful for labels, collectives or artists with many projects
* **Live Preview** let you see what does what instantly.
* **Integrates perfectly** with wordpress media upload by using the same listing style that you get with the images.
* **Plugin construct the shortode for you**, no need to remember any crasy syntax (but you can still use the shortcode manually if needed).
* **Widget** for showing the latest or random tracks, favourites or sets for one user, multiple users or random users.
* **Track's info** displayed directly in the tab (description, url, cover, etc...).
* Default settings from the option page (see screenshot):
    * Default player type (Standard, Artwork, Visual)
    * Width
    * Extra Classes for the div that wraps around the player
    * Auto Play
    * Show/Hide Comments
    * Player's Colours
* Styled sortcode in editor for neat layout.
* Implement Soundcloud Html5 player.
* Follow WP developpers guidelines (enqueue scripts and styles just for the plugin, clean code, commented, secure and leave no trace when uninstall ).
* https support


= Advantages against pasting embed code from soundcloud and other plugins =

* By changing the main settings in the options, all players on your site using the default settings will change. If green isn't trendy anymore and purple is the new orange, it won't be a problem and you will keep your street credibility.
* If Soundcloud update their player or release an even cooler new player that let you scratch your track while streaming to snapchat, I will most defenetly update the plugin to use those new features.
* **Soundcloud is Gold** use a shortcode but the "Soundcloud is Gold" tab will write it for you dynamically as you select parameters, and on top of this it will provide a nice live preview of your player so you know what does what. When done just press the 'insert soundcloud player' and it will added to your post just like when you're adding a photo or gallery.

== RoadMap ==

= Priority =

* Contextual On-boarding to help new users getting to know the plugin
* Use your own API key (which mean you're not dependent of the rate_limit attached to my key )
* Advance Settings (change background color and comments color, playcounts, buy link, font, wmode, etc, show/hide styled shortcode, number of tracks per page)
* Other soundcloud shortcode conflict fix (jetpack)
* Update to the way Settings are handled to be even more inline with Wordpress settings API.
* Live search while typing a name in the user name field. So if you're looking for someone it's kind of easier.
* Better UX for the editor: clicking to edit should know if which user and if it's a track/playlist/favourite
* Better UX for the editor: Better visual to actually know what the track is just by looking at it.

= Secondary =

* Seperate playlists into playlist types (ep, album, etc...)
* Url attribute for shortcode: easier for people using the shortcode manually.
* Trigger live preview when changing Soundcloud user name
* Add 'activities' to the widget


== Installation ==

Just follow the usual procedure. Log on to your wordpress, go to plugin üëâ Add New üëâ search 'Soundcloud is Gold' üëâ click install.




== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't see my tracks? =

* Have you entered your real username? Your username is what you see in your soundcloud url when you click your name in soundcloud or view public profile (e.g http://soundcloud.com/anna-chocola ).
* Bare in mind is that all tracks that are set as private on soundcloud won't appear.
* Have you got other soundcloud plugin installed? That generally happen as you've been 'shopping around', disable them or even delete them and this if it works.

= It's behaving strangely or working partially or I've check everything but it still doesn't work =

Here's a simple method to track down incompatibilities with plugins and themes:

* Disable all plugins
* Enable 'soundcloud is gold' and check if it works (add a track to a post to be sure)
* If it worked: enable the other plugins one by one and check if it breaks
* If it didn't worked: enable the default Worpress theme and check if it works (add a track to a post to be sure).

Remenber that even if a plugin is popular, most of the plugins are badly coded or the developer didn't follow Wordpress guidelines on plugin development. Therefor conflict happens. The method is useful not just for this plugin.

= Do you have some documentation for the shortcode? =

If for some reason you wish to use the shortcode manually, here's what's possible:

**id or user is required for the shortcode to work**
[soundcloud id='trackID']: The id of the track, favorite or playlist.

[soundcloud user='yourUsername'] : This will always display the latest track (will overwrite id if set)

**Those attributes are optional**
comments: True or False
autoplay: True or False
playertype: 'Standard'
width: px or % (for example 56px or 56%)
color: rgb hex color code (for example #005bff)
show_artwork: True or False
visual: True or False (overwrites show_artwork)
show_comments: True or False
format: 'tracks' or 'playlists'



= Can I request features? =

Yes, you can. If asked nicely and the requests are sensibles, I almost always integrate them to new releases.

= Can you help me? =

Sometimes, I generally keep a eye on my plugin's forums and website's comments. Bear in mind that I've got a full time job and a life, so I can't always help straight away. I will not reply to people who obviously don't read the faqs or the forum or just say 'it doesn't work'.
