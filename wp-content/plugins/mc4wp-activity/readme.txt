Shows activity for your MailChimp lists, right in your WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

This plugin shows your MailChimp lists activity, right in your WordPress dashboard.

= MailChimp lists activity =

Once activated, it will show a new dashboard widget containing a bar-graph or line-graph ([screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mc4wp-activity/screenshots/)) showing day-to-day changes to your MailChimp lists. You can choose to view relative activity (daily subscribes vs. unsubscribes) or a line graph visualizing your total list sizes.

**Requirements**

This plugin has the following requirements.

- The [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/) plugin (3.0 or higher).
- PHP 5.3 or higher.

To get started with the plugin, please have a look at the [installation guide](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mc4wp-activity/installation/).

== Installation ==

= MailChimp Activity =

Since this plugin depends on the [MailChimp for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/), you will need to install that first.

Also, please make sure that your webserver is running PHP 5.3 or higher.

= Installing the plugin =

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **MailChimp Activity** and click "*Install now*"
1. Alternatively, download the plugin files manually and upload the contents of `mailchimp-activity.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin
1. Make sure your API key is set.
1. You should now see a new widget on your dashboard. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which user roles can see the activity widget? =

By default, the widget will only be shown to users with `manage_options` capability (administrators).

This behaviour can be customized using the `mc4wp_activity_capability` filter.

`
// Show MailChimp Activity widget to editor role & up.
add_filter( 'mc4wp_activity_capability', function( $capability ) {
   return 'edit_posts';
});
`

= I've activated MailChimp Activity - but it does nothing =

This usually comes down to any (or multiple) of the following reasons.

- No API key is set in **MailChimp for WP > MailChimp**.
- You're running an older version of [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/), version 3.0 or higher is required.
- Your server is running a very outdated version of PHP. MailChimp Activity requires at least PHP 5.3 or higher.
- If you see the widget but it's stuck at "loading..", there should be [a JavaScript error in your browser console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) telling us what exactly went wrong.
